# what-should-i-wear-today

"What Should I Wear Today?" is a jQuery-based app that recommends today's look based on user's styles and daily conditions.

## Target Users
I wanted to target both male and female users who struggle in the morning when they get ready because it's difficult to choose what to wear.

## Usage
My application can provide a quick, easy solution to my users if they spend around 1 minute to finish the quiz and get their result, including a photo of the whole outfit and explanations.

## Built with:
- jQuery
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Sass
- HTML5

## To-Do's
Some things I'd love to include to improve my app:
- making it more accessible in Chrome and Edge by letting users tab through each question and option without seeing auto-scrolling happening unexpectedly
- an optional longer version for those who are looking for more accurate results
- hyperlinks to online retailers where users can buy the individual featured (and/or similar) items
- higher-quality photos that look more cohesive together
