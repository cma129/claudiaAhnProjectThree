# what-should-i-wear-today

"What Should I Wear Today?" is a jQuery-based app that recommends today's look based on user's styles and daily conditions.


I wanted to target both male and female users who struggle in the morning when they get ready because it's difficult to choose what to wear.

My application can provide a quick, easy solution to my users if they spend around 1 minute to finish the quiz and get their result, including a photo of the whole outfit and explanations.


On top of jQuery, I also used Vanilla JavaScript, Sass, and HTML5 to build this app.

Some things I'd love to improve include:
- making it more accessible in Chrome and Edge by letting users tab through each question and option without seeing auto-scrolling happening unexpectedly
- an optional longer version for those who are looking for more accurate results
- hyperlinks to online retailers where users can buy the individual featured (and/or similar) items
- higher-quality photos that look more cohesive together
